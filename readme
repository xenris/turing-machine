Turing machine.

Use:
    After running "build.sh" on a *nix machine the runnable binary will be
    located in the "bin" folder. (build.sh uses the clang compiler.)
    The binary takes the turing machine source file path as its only argument.
    e.g. "./bin/turing example.tu" to run.
    Strings to be processed are entered through stdin.

Todo:
    Print help message.
    Use the "alphabet" value in the source code to validate the input data
        and source code.
    Add a command to print each step. (Currently implemented as a compile time
        value "printSubSteps".)
